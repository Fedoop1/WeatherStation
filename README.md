# WeatherStation
Develop a type system for modeling some WeatherStation, which operates on the basis of the patented WeatherData object, which tracks the current weather conditions (Temperature, Humidity, Pressure).

Develop a class system for creating a current summary of weather conditions (CurrentConditionsReport) and their statistics (StatisticReport). All data should be updated in real time as the WeatherData object receives the latest changes.

Propose two solutions (Pattern Observer (interfaces) + event).

Simulate the operation of a weather station in a console application or implement tests.
